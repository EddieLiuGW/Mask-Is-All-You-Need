# Improving MPCitH with Preprocessing: Mask Is All You Need

**Final_Submission**: This is the final version of the submission.

The **Software** file is the software implementation project, and the implementation environment is the Ubuntu 22.04 system. (Also allowed on Windows Visual Studio)

The **Hardware/LowMC-MPC-LJWJ-12cycle** and **Hardware/LowMC-MPC-LJWJ-8cycle** are the hardware implementation projects of the mpc phase mentioned in [this paper](https://tches.iacr.org/index.php/TCHES/article/view/11425/10931), corresponding to 12 cycles and 8 cycles respectively. 

The **Hardware/LowMC-MPC-New-Section4** and **Hardware/LowMC-MPC-New-Section5**  are the optimized hardware implementation projects proposed by us, corresponding to the optimization of Section 4 and Section 5 respectively.
